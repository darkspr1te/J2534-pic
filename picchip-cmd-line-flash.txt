Each option must be immediately preceeded by a switch, Which can
be either a dash <-> or a slash </> and options must be separated
by a single space.


Commands and their parameters are not case sensitive. Commands will
be processed according to command order of precedence, not the order
in which they appear on the command line.

The program will return an exit code upon completion which will
indicate either successful completion, or describe the reason for 
failure.
